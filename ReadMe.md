Spring Batch Sort-Merge
=======================

Overview
--------
This package contains general purpose flat file sorting and merging
tasklets for use within Spring Batch applications.  These tasklets
are designed to function in out-of-core scenarios where very large
input files may not fit into main memory.

Releases can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/upcrob/spring-batch-sort-merge/releases/latest).

Building
--------
This project is built using <a href="http://www.gradle.org">Gradle</a>.
To build, simply type the following at the command prompt while in
the directory with the `build.gradle` file:

	./gradlew build

The jar will subsequently be generated in build/libs.

To build an Eclipse project file, use the following command:

	./gradlew eclipse

Usage
-----

### Sorting ###
Sorting is accomplished by creating a new instance of `FlatFileSortTasklet`
and setting the following properties:

*inputResource* - A `FileSystemResource` indicating the flat file that
should be sorted.

*outputResource* - A `FileSystemResource` indicating the output file that
should be created.

*inputIoFactory* - An instance of `FlatFileItemIoFactory` that corresponds
with the *inputResource*.  Implementations of `FlatFileItemIoFactory` can
be written to define an item reader and writer that correspond to a given
file format (eg. a csv file with columns: id,age,name).

*outputIoFactory* - An instance of `FlatFileItemIoFactory` that corresponds
with the output file.

*tmpDirectory* - A temporary writeable directory available to the tasklet in
the event that the entire input file does not fit into main memory and
temporary files must be created.

*comparator* - Defines the relationship between file record objects and how they should be sorted.

### Merging ###
Merging files into a single file can be accomplished by creating an instance
of `FlatFileMergeTasklet` and setting the following properties:

*readers* - A list of `FlatFileItemReader` corresponding to the input files
to merge.

*writer* - A `FlatFileItemWriter` that corresponds to the output (merged)
file.

*comparator* - A Comparator that defines the relationship between input
file records and how they should be ordered.

Note that `FlatFileMergeTasklet` assumes that its input files are already
sorted.  If this cannot be guaranteed, sort them witih `FlatFileSortTasklet`
prior to the merge operation.
